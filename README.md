# goto

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EngineerBetter/goto.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EngineerBetter/goto)

Makes it easier to `cd` between projects in `$GOPATH` and `~/workspace/`.

Inspired by [Pivotal's Bash functions](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux/wiki/Garden-development-workstation-setup).
